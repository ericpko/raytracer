# raytracer
I made a tiny rayracer as a way to learn Rust. This raytracer comes from the [Computer Graphics course](https://github.com/alecjacobson/computer-graphics-ray-tracing) at the University of Toronto taught by [Alec Jacobson](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jacobson/).

## Installation
- Clone the git repo https://github.com/ericpko/raytracer.git
- cd into the repo, then run the following commands:
- cargo build --release
- cargo run --release ./data/<json-filename>.json

After you execute the raytracer, you will see the images created in the `images` folder. You can also create your own JSON file and set up your own scene to render using geometric primitives such as spheres, planes, and triangles!

# Images
Here are some cool images you can create with this raytracer!
<img src="readme-png/creative.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Sphere and plane" width="640" height="500"> </div>
<img src="readme-png/sphere-and-plane.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Sphere and plane" width="640" height="500"> </div>
<img src="readme-png/two-spheres-and-plane.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Sphere and plane" width="640" height="500"> </div>
